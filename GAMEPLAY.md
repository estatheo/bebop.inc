# Gameplay Mechanics

## Mine Resource (Minigame / Auto)
- **Manual Mining**: Player dives into a timed mining sequence with limited oxygen and a laser tool. Clearing rocks before the timer expires yields resources, while occasional enemies drop scrap for additional upgrades.
- **Automated Mining**: Drones automatically harvest minerals each second once purchased.
- **Balancing**: Manual mining establishes early engagement; automation rewards progression while freeing the player to explore other systems.

## Spend Resource
- **Construct Miners/Drones/Stations**: Invest minerals or credits to build units that increase mining throughput.
- **Upgrade Efficiency**: Spend resources to improve mining yields.
- **Upgrade Tree**: Credits unlock nodes on a branching tree, granting new abilities.
- **Strategic Choices**: Players must decide between building more units or upgrading existing equipment.

## Expand
- **New Resources**: Introduce Ice, Gas, and Rare Metals with unique uses.
- **Research & Exploration**: Unlock technologies to visit planets, asteroids, and stations, each with distinct resource profiles.
- **Progression Curve**: Expansion opens additional mechanics and story arcs, keeping longâ€‘term goals in sight.

## Gameplay Loop Concepts
1. **Gather**: Mine resources manually or via automation.
2. **Spend**: Use resources for upgrades or new structures.
3. **Unlock**: Access new locations, resources, and narrative layers.
4. **Repeat**: Each loop introduces fresh goals, maintaining engagement and a sense of growth.

These mechanics form the foundation for an engaging incremental experience where players constantly weigh immediate gains against future rewards.
