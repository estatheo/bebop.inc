# Chapter 1 Progression

This document outlines the full progression flow for the first chapter of the Bebop Inc incremental game.

1. **Awakening at Base** – the player begins at a derelict base with a single action: travel to a nearby asteroid.
2. **Manual Mining Minigame** – on resource sites the player plays a timing-based minigame to harvest 1 unit per success. Later locations provide ice, gas, or rare metals.
3. **Trading Minerals** – back at base, 10 minerals can be exchanged for 1 credit.
4. **Upgrade Tree** – credits unlock nodes on a branching tree improving tools, movement, and cargo capacity.
5. **First Milestone** – after earning 5 credits the player unlocks a drone bay blueprint.
6. **Mining Drones** – drones cost credits to build and automatically mine, feeding resources directly into storage.
7. **New Resources** – sustained mining uncovers ice, then gas, and eventually rare metals that enable advanced tech.
8. **Outpost Construction** – with rare metals the player erects a small space outpost that boosts drone efficiency.
9. **Foreshadowing Finds** – mysterious artifacts and messages hint at other survivors and forgotten technologies.
10. **Chapter Finale** – accumulating 50 credits and constructing the outpost unlocks the ability to form a party, ending Chapter 1.

These steps set the stage for future chapters where the player leaves the solitude of mining behind and ventures into a wider universe.
